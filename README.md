## About The Project

This is a simple small pokedex using the 151 original pokemon as a base, the application is expandable for the future, however, will likely stay the same so I can
move onto other projects!
This was my first personal project so it isn't perfect, but I hope you enjoy it eitherway!

I was struggling to find something regarding API's that I could really enjoy and stick too, as a first 'COMPELTED' project I'm happy to say I acomplished my goal.

Here's why:
* I'm a huge fan of the pokemon series and perhaps someday I'll rebuild this to a full scale app!
* I wanted to practice using API's, not related to any of my current clearning tasks, but why not!?
* Test as much of my knowledge as possible without the need for research, I'm happy to search for information; however, I wanted to really test my capabilities. (It isn't all memory though :P).
* Finally, I wanted to build an application using NPM, Webpack & Git.
